Spread::Session version 0.1
===========================

Wrapper module for Spread.pm, providing an object-oriented interface
to the Spread messaging toolkit.  The existing Spread.pm package is
a straightforward functional interface to the Spread C API.

A session represents a connection to a Spread messaging daemon.  The
publish and subscribe functions are for communication via spread groups.

Handling of incoming messages is supported via callbacks; the receive()
method does not directly return the incoming message parameters to the
calling code.
